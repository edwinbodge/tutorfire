<h2> Edwin Bodge </h2>

<p>In Tutor Mode, I added the tutor’s list of courses as a recyclerview populated with card views. This allows the user to add a course with a FloatingActionButton, and delete a course after being presented with a dialog.</p>
<p>Additionally, I created the tutor’s list of students with a similar view. The layout allows the tutor to directly chat with their student and view more information from their student profile.</p>
<p>Moving forward, I will be designing the final scheduling tool. This will be formatted like a Doodle poll. We still need to create a splash screen, redesign the UI, and incorporate the camera and Google Calendar API.</p>

<h2> Harrison Lundberg </h2>

<p>I finished implementing all of the needed methods in the WebServiceInterface package. Additionally, I updated our DataClasses package by adding the Time class and making Tutors and Courses parcelable. </p>

<p>I also worked on the TutorModeActivities package, adding activities dealing with the tutors free-time slots. Specifically, the tutor can now view his/her free time slots, add a new time slot, and remove a time slot. As Edwin said, we will eventually like to change the UI to be more like a Doodle poll for scheduling free time slots. </p>


<h2> Alex Boldt </h2>
<p>Students can now add the same tutor for an arbitrary amount of classes and maintain communication with them. </p>

<h2> Lin Lin Pan </h2>
<p> </p>

<h2> Updates for the next version </h2>

<p>Add the ability for a student to remove a tutor from his/her list</p>
<p>Improve the UI of the app</p>
<p>Add a splash screen</p>
<p>Incorporate the camera into the chat</p>
<p>Incorporate the Google Calendar API</p>
<p>Refactoring</p>

<h1 align="center"> Alpha Version </h1>
<div class = "project-info">



<h2> Edwin Bodge </h2>

<p>Built out tutor mode to allow tutors to view their list of tutors, in addition to an expanded view of that student’s information. Next immediate step - create an option for tutors to specify the courses they are able to teach.</p>

<p>Developed, updated, and managed team website. Expanded a new .html tab with project updates (as seen here!). </p>

<h2> Harrison Lundberg </h2>

<p>I created the web service on a Duke VM using MySQL and PHP. This web service stores all the information about tutors - which courses they teach and at what times. I then started working on the WebServiceInterface package of our project, whose interface is methods that Student and Tutor mode activities can call to get information from the web service. These methods are implemented using HTTP requests with Volley. </p>
<p>I also implemented the necessary JSON parsers (JSONParsers package) to translate the web server’s responses into data objects (DataClasses package). These data objects are then passed onto the appropriate activities in either Student or Tutor Mode.</p>

<h2> Alex Boldt </h2>
<p>Build out student mode with input for desired classes, listing current known tutors, and communicating with said tutors</p>

<p>Create chat feature that allows tutors and students to talk to one another, in order to coordinate meeting times, locations, and subjects</p>

<h2> Lin Lin Pan </h2>
<p> Creating JUNIT tests for parsers</p>
