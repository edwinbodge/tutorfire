<div class = "project-info">

<p>Our app is called TutorFire, and it is a new way for students to connect with tutors that best meet their demands. The app will have two modes, one for students and one for tutors. After creating an account and signing in, the user will be able to use the app. </p>

<p>While in student mode, the user will be able to specify what subject they need help in and what times work best for him/her. After querying a database of tutors, the matching list of tutors will be shown to the user, along with their contact information. The student will then be able to select a specific tutor from the list and initiate a chat with them. We will also allow the tutor-student pair to schedule a meeting directly from the app using Google Calendar. </p>

<p>While in tutor mode, the user can set the classes in which they are proficient and what time slots they are available. This information will be used to update the database of tutors. Tutors will also be able to see recent messages from students and schedule meetings with them. </p>

<p>We anticipate creating a remote database to hold information about tutors, which will be queried whenever a student is searching for a tutor. </p>

<p>We also anticipate using the Google Calendar API, or something similar, to schedule meetings directly from the app. </p>

<p>For handling users and authentication, we plan on using Firebase Authentication. </p>

<p>We also plan to use the phone's camera to allow tutors to add a profile picture to their information that is shown to the students. </p>
